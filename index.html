        <p id="pofabout">I am Sunil Gaire AKA Anonymous Craft. This Hardcore world was created on July 20, 2022, 9:10:13 AM. I created this Hardcore world to have fun while making World record breaking projects. The reason behind creating a Hardcore World instead of Normal world is that I want to have little thrill of loosing the world and all the progress because of small mistake.

        <p class="phome1">This was the start to my very exiciting Hardcore world that went very exiciting with time. I started this world just to have fun while playing minecraft but also with a thrill and fear of loosing all the progress because of small mistake. During the creation of the world Minecraft hardcore was very popular all over the internet so I also gave it a try. I got a very lucky seed that that. There was a village near my spawn point and there is also a mineshaft below the village so I had a preety good place for living in day.On the left you can see the skeleten spwanner that I found on the mineshaft. I noted the co-ordinates of the spwanner because I was planning to build a skeleten spwanner XP farm that will also give me other things like bones and arrows. </p>
